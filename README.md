## Generation of Synthetic EMG data:
here some initial details about generation of synthetic data

## Effects of Amplitude Normalization: 
here figure and brief text about amplitude normalization

## Proposal: Consider scaling co-contraction values to the theoretical maximum of their index to facilitate comparisons between indices and studies.
more detailed illustration and brief text about scaling CCI to theoretical maximum
